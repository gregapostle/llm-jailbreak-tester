# 🧪 LLM Jailbreak Prompt Tester

A Streamlit-based app that tests prompt injection vulnerabilities against a local open-source language model (e.g., TinyLlama). This project allows researchers and engineers to experiment with jailbreak prompts and examine whether the model responds unsafely or ignores safety policies.

---

## 📌 Overview

This tool allows you to:

* Input your own potentially malicious prompts
* Generate auto-suggested red team prompts
* Run all prompts through a locally loaded LLM (TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat)
* Analyze responses to flag potential jailbreaks
* Export all results as a CSV for further evaluation

It's designed for red teamers, prompt engineers, LLM security researchers, or anyone curious about AI model robustness.

## 🧠 Next Steps

* Add a scoring model for jailbreak confidence
* Try larger models like Mistral or Mixtral
* Hook into Rebuff for additional threat detection
